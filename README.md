# Hello-world
My intro repository

Hello there, my name is Andrew Witkowskyj and I am relatively new to all of this so bear with me for a little while. I started learning to code on freecodecamp and ended up here, I'm still a little unsure of where here is though. I decided to learn to code because it's a interesting and complex challenge, and I find it rather enjoyable, which was surprising to say the least. Well, thanks for reading.
